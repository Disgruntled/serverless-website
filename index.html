    <h1>This website has no server</h1>
    <P><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludacris'>Ludacris</a>, I know but bare with me for a moment. This website is powered entirely using cloudflare workers. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/products/cloudflare-workers/">Cloudflare workers</a> implements the Javascript ServiceWorkers API server side (or more specifically, at the edge)</P>
    <p> It's a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing'>serverless</a> computing solution that's a lot of fun</p>
    <p>It's intended use is to offload a bit of work from your busy servers. You're saving a lot of extra hops when you use a worker, either in your browser or in cloudflare to fulfill your request</p>
    <p>It's particularly attractive where you want to write a single page app, but don't want to put all the trust in your user's user-agent. </p>
    <P>This was done by creating cloudflare workers with a default route of https://exit23a.ca/* and http://exit23a.ca/* </P>
    <p>The actual IP address that's set to "orange cloud" in cloudflare for my account is a random IP for google.com. The service worker intercepts the request and I've configure it to never send the actual traffic to google</p>

<h1>Faq</h1>
    <h3>Do I recommend this?</h3>
    <p>Definitely not. Not only is it needlessly complicated, it also breaks a lot of cloudflares built in functionality. A great example is that I had to use a "page rule" to upconvert all traffic to HTTPS because the built in cloud flare functionality is broken.</p>
    <p>Another example: workers are evaluated before cloud flare apps, but after page rules. So "apps" are also out. </p>
    <h3>Then why do it?</h3>
    <p>A good way to get test out my own knowledge of javascript and to just see if I could do something quirky</p>
    <h3>Why cloudflare? Why not lambda at the edge or lambda + apigateway</h3>
    <p>Cloudflare is simpler. AWS is incredible, but there is a lot of overhead to making something work.</p>
    <h3>Where is the data stored</h3>
    <p>In Cloudflare workers key-value (KV)pairs. Such that the content itself is stored in cloudflare. </p>
    <h3>Can I find some examples of this, I'm curious</h3>
    <p>Yes, you should be able to check out some really simple code on my <a href='https://github.com/disgruntled'>GitHub</a></p>
    <h3>How do you update this website</h3>
    <p>I use the cloudflare workers key value API to overwrite the entry that stores this file. It's quite powerful, with minimal effort this could be made into a dynamic CMS</p>
